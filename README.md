# Introduction
QuickQuiz is a quiz site that started out as a [tutorial](https://github.com/jamesqquick/Build-A-Quiz-App-With-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript), but I enjoyed creating it so much that I decided to add functionality that extended beyond the scope of the original project. Some Javascript topics include using storage and interfacing with external APIs. Some CSS topics include the use of flexbox, animations, and REM units.
